# Learning & Experimentation
This repo used to take note about my personal project, for educational purposes. Aiming to experiment with various server applications and acknowledge Linux systems.

## Goals:
- Learn by Doing
- Media Management: Utilize `qBittorrent`, and `Plex`, `Emby`, `Kodi` to make a **media server**. \
I'm trying to automate them all. 
  - Use RSS feed to download torrent file.
  - Get the subtitle.
  - Update metadata and poster/cover.
  - Organize the libraries.
- Network: Using `AdGuard Home` for security and ads blocking.
- Other stuffs:
  - `Prometheus`
    - Curently running in agent mode with remote write to reduce disk I/O, and easily access `Grafana Dashboard` on the cloud.
  - `vsftpd`: File transfer
  - `rsync`: Manually sync files between my local drive and seedbox.

I will update as I progress through the project.
